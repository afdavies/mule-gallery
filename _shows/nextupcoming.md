Tiny Pricks is a project in which participants stitch quotes by Trump into antique or inherited textiles to create a material record of his presidency. Pieces are donated to a travelling collection to be exhibited around the country. The methodology of the project is based on social media sharing, participatory political protest, and craftivism. To view over 300 pieces created to date, please follow the series on [Diana Weymar's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dianaweymar). Tiny Pricks counterbalances the impermanence of Twitter, social media, and Trumpâ€™s overall approach to politics.
