The DDC gang is coming back to San Francisco! 

Back in March of 2016, the [Draplin Design Company](https://www.instagram.com/draplin/) came to our gallery to do a pop-up store and art show. On opening night, the line was all the way down the street and around the corner - it was INCREDIBLE! They'll be back in April to do it all over again!

They'll be installing as much stuff as they possibly can fit on our gallery walls and setting up a weekend long pop-up shop with LIMITED EDITION San Francisco goodies, a roster of colorful screen print posters, patches, pins, decals, hats, beanies, DDC books, slipcases, cups, [Field Notes](https://www.instagram.com/fieldnotesbrand/), [Notes to Self](https://www.instagram.com/_notes_to_self/) nasties, wearables, totes, leather goods, doo-dads, what-the-hells, and must-have trinkets!

Opening night is Friday, April 26th, 6-9pm. The pop-up shop will continue Saturday and Sunday, April 27th-28th, 12-6pm.
