In America we make promises. We have promised the American Dream, the Industrial Revolution, and Inalienable Rights throughout the centuries. Sometimes we deliver those promises and sometimes we fall far short. In Michigan, we have work to do.

A Rock and a Hard Place is a visual study of Michigan. Artist Inga Loyeva visited Michigan to work on a collaborative community mural as a part of her Art For Civil Discourse projects in October 2017. The time spent there filled her with hope for a better America through the lens of the people crafting meaning in Michigan's cities. In this exposition, the artist portrays the scenes in both Detroit and Flint that narrates the intense philosophical debate in contemporary America. Do we deserve a dignified existence, and, if so, at what cost?

Loyevaâ€™s work draws philosophical inquiry into paintings. They are stories told through the labor of oil painting, a form of socratic method applied in visual language. Captivated by painting not only because of its versatility as a medium but also because of its rich historical archive of images and ideas she designs visual narratives that ask questions and provokes conversation. Inga is intensely interested in understanding the world through the edges of rules where dogma descends into choice.
