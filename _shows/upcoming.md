Jim Krewson first learned the value of being an artist in grammar school. To avoid being beaten up by the local bullies,
he mastered the art of drawing naked women. His drawings and paintings today are inspired by stereotypes from sub and pop culture, often through the dirty lens of his sick humor. His images and sculptures are made in a stylized and unabashedly illustrative and handmade fashion that perverts reality. More often than not, the work operates on an exploitative or visceral level, leaving the question of morality to the viewer. Krewson's past subject matter has ranged from a giant airbrushed portait of Carol Channing partying down at the Rolling Stones' infamous Altamont concert to a more recent kinetic sculpture of a woodland dirt clump that plays an electric guitar to Sharpie drawings of lesbian bikers being enchanted by woodland witches.

Jim Krewson was born in Bucks County, PA in 1967. In 1997 he left his past career as a decorator of erotic cakes to become
a visual artist and bluegrass musician. He has been showing his work since then.
