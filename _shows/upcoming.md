[Jennifer Daniel](http://httpcolonforwardslashforwardslashwwwdotjenniferdanieldotcom.com/) is a serious, real artist focused on the divergence of language. What starts out as contemplation soon becomes debased into a tragedy of greed, leaving only a sense of nihilism and the possibility of a new order. As spatial forms become reconfigured through colons and parenthesis, the viewer is left with an epitaph to the limits of how we communicate.

She is an artist who covers a breadth of topics — ranging from government shut downs, tech culture, and cross-cultural identity. Jennifer Daniel's work has been published in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Wired and she is a regular contributor to The New York Times. Daniel is the author of many books, including [Space!](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Graphics-Space-Simon-Rogers/dp/0763677698/ref=pd_sim_b_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0Z213M7RRTZFGH8ZYF37), [The Origin of Almost Everything](https://www.amazon.com/New-Scientist-Origin-almost-Everything-ebook/dp/B01HZFB8YO), and How To be Human. She lives in San Francisco, but still keeps all of her clocks set to New York time.
