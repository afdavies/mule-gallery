San Francisco Underground: 50 Years and Counting...

[V. Vale](https://www.instagram.com/vale_research/) is best-known for publishing the first Bay Area "Punk Rock" zine, SEARCH & DESTROY in 1977 with funding from Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In 1980 he launched [RE/Search](https://www.researchpubs.com/) with funding from Rough Trade Records' Geoff Travis which produced cultural game-changers such as [Modern Primitives](https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/paperback-modern-primitives-20th-anniv-also-deluxe-hardback-2/), [Industrial Culture Handbook](https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/hardback-research-67-industrial-culture-handbook-2/), [Angry Women](https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/research-13-angry-women-2/) (performance art), [Incredibly Strange Films](https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/incredibly-strange-films/), [Pranks](https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/pranks-conner/) and most recently, [Bruce Conner: The Afternoon Interviews](https://www.researchpubs.com/shop/bruce-conner-the-afternoon-interviews/). Along the way Vale shot over 100,000 photographs of "the Underground," a few of which will be displayed.

Marian Wallace is a filmmaker, painter, electronic musician and printmaker with a B.F.A. and M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute. She was a founding member of the underground film collective "No Nothing" which showed independent films for free starting in the early 1980s. Her newest paintings and a silkscreen print of The Ramones will be on display. A public screening of her films may be announced to coincide with this exhibition, time permitting.
