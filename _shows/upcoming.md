[Jen Hewett](http://jenhewett.com/) is a printmaker, surface designer, textile artist and teacher. A lifelong Californian, Jen combines her love of loud prints and saturated colors with the textures and light of the California landscapes to create highly-tactile, visually-layered, printed textiles.

As a child growing up in Los Angeles, printmaker and textile artist [Jen Hewett](https://www.instagram.com/jenhewett) didn’t pay close attention to the lawns surrounding her. Lawns were meant to be lush, mown, and uniformly green – a nearly-impossible feat in constantly drought-stricken Southern California. It wasn’t until 2016, when California started to emerge from a five-year drought and the lawns of her neighboring Golden Gate Park grew more quickly than its gardeners could manage that she noticed, for the first time, the diversity contained within a patch of grass – not just grasses, but also clover, mallow, plantain. She began to pay close attention to the ground, documenting what she saw on her daily walks, and researching the names and varieties of each weed. Weedwatching is a collection of Jen’s interpretations of these mini-landscapes.
