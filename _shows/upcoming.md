The Social Justice Sewing Academy (SJSA) presents “Generation of Change: A Movement, Not a Moment,” an exhibit of art quilts created by workshop participants of diverse backgrounds from San Francisco, Richmond, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore and Austin. The interactive exhibit demonstrates the powerful collaboration that goes into each quilt block while offering visitors an opportunity to participate in the social justice “artivism” experience. These engaging works of art inform, educate, empower and advocate, while centering voices typically left out of art activism, such as those of incarcerated youth. The featured quilts address topics such as: racial justice, LGBTQ+, climate change, immigration and more and the art expresses a range of emotions from anger and sadness, to hope for social and political change.

Founded in 2016, SJSA is a non-profit arts education program that brings together artist-mentors, youth, and community members to learn and create through textile art projects. SJSA supports youth to become civically engaged artists as they are challenged to address social issues in their community that directly affect their lives.
