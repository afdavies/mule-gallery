San Francisco Underground: 50 Years and Counting...

(V. Vale)[https://www.instagram.com/vale_research/] is best-known for publishing the first Bay Area "Punk Rock" zine, SEARCH & DESTROY in 1977 with funding from Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In 1980 he launched (RE/Search)[https://www.researchpubs.com/] with funding from Rough Trade Records' Geoff Travis which produced cultural game-changers such as MODERN PRIMITIVES, INDUSTRIAL CULTURE HANDBOOK, ANGRY WOMEN (performance art), INCREDIBLY STRANGE FILMS, PRANKS and most recently, BRUCE CONNER: The Afternoon Interviews. Along the way Vale shot over 100,000 photographs of "the Underground," a few of which are displayed here.

Marian Wallace is a filmmaker, painter, electronic musician and printmaker with a B.F.A. and M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute. She was a founding member of the underground film collective "No Nothing" which showed independent films for free starting in the early 1980s. Her newest paintings and a silkscreen print of The Ramones are displayed here. (A public screening of her films may be announced to coincide with this exhibition, time permitting.)
