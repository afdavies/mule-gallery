[Diana Weymar](https://www.instagram.com/dianaweymar/) developed _[Interwoven Stories](https://www.facebook.com/InterwovenStories/)_ as 2016 Artist-in-Residence at the Arts Council of Princeton and brings over 100 pages from Princeton, The Peddie School, the Nantucket Stitching Gam, the Zen Hospice Project (San Francisco), Open Space Art (Damascus, Syria), Build Peace (Colombia), the University of Puget Sound (Tacoma), Yarns/NoDominion Theatre (Jersey City), and Trans Tipping Point Project (Victoria, BC). “As an international project that originated in Princeton, it’s extremely exciting to see how people from around the world have been inspired to join in the collective narrative.”
