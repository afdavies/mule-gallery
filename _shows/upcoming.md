We are thrilled to have Brooklyn-based designer [Kelli Anderson](http://www.kellianderson.com/) presenting Around & Around, the final show of 2016 at Mule Gallery. The show opens on November 4, 2016 and closes on December 23, 2016. A reception for the artist will be held on November 4 from 6-9pm.

Around & Around is a exhibition of mostly-handheld objects that have been "programmed" to be rotated, spun, or perambulated. The show features kaleidoscopic volvellves, a paper prognostication device, origami lenticulars, a recursive card, and prototypes of a new pop-up book that functions as a record player. By engaging the viewer to play, ponder, and tinker, each piece invites direct interaction with invisible forces larger than is implied by its lo-fi form.

Kelli Anderson is an interaction designer interested in exposing invisible forces at play in the world. Next Fall, she will publish This Book is a Planetarium — a collection of functional pop-up contraptions — which includes a tiny paper planetarium, and explains how humble structures can perform extraordinary feats. 

Kelli is known for her design, animation, and illustration work for NPR, The New Yorker, Wired, and MoMA—as well as her redesign of brands such as Russ & Daughters, Munchery, and momofuku. Popular projects have included a book that becomes a pinhole camera when opened (This Book is a Camera), design for Tinybop’s acclaimed Human Body app, and a counterfeit NY Times action (as part of activist group, The Yes Men).

Thanks to our sponsors [Fort Point Beer Company](http://www.fortpointbeer.com/) for keeping us hydrated at the reception.
