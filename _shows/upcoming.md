V. Vale is an editor, writer-interviewer, historian, photographer and pianist. He was the
publisher-editor of the 1977-79 zine SEARCH & DESTROY launched with $100 each from
Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and published at City Lights Bookstore in San
Francisco. For Vale, Punk provided a launching pad for cultural-anthropological explorations,
including Industrial music, the writings of J.G. Ballard and William S. Burroughs, feminism,
plus “Incredibly Strange” filmmaking and music, which he has chronicled with the
RE/SEARCH series of publications founded in 1980. The RE/Search series have become
the equivalent of a countercultural bible: essential reading not only for Punks — all the
books, Vale swears, are informed by that Revolution — but artists, musicians, and cultural
fire-starters. Vale built a bridge with his paperbacks between cultural movers around him and
the world of books: “I learned long ago that reading is not a passive process, I like to mark up
my books. My books are heavily interacted with. I look at books not as books, but as
conversations.”

J.G. Ballard, William S. Burroughs, Dead Kennedys, Devo, Philip K. Dick, DNA, Brion Gysin,
George Kuchar, Timothy Leary, Lydia Lunch, David Lynch, Octave Mirbeau, Genesis P.
Orridge, Iggy Pop, Henry Rollins, Siouxsie Sioux, SRL, Suicide, Sun Ra, Television, John
Waters. V. Vale has covered them all.

Marian Wallace studied film and drawing at San Francisco Art Institute in the late
1970s-early 1980s, working with George Kuchar, Gunvor Nelson, Lawrence Jordan
and other mostly non-narrative filmmakers, as well as the painter, Sam Tchakalian.
Following graduation, she worked for a decade or so on feature and independent
film soundtracks under Walter Murch, Richard Beggs, Francis Coppola (e.g. “The
Godfather Part 3”) and Bruce Conner, among others. Meanwhile she had become
closely involved in forming and participating in San Francisco’s experimental film
“salon de refusè”: NoNothing Cinema, where independent films of all stripes were
screened weekly in a fun and celebratory fashion, alongside projection-based
installations and performances.

After joining forces with V. Vale of RE/Search Publications in the early 1990s,
Marian collaborated with him, documenting interviews with Punk and Industrial
musicians and other cultural and countercultural people, many in the service of
book projects.

In 2016 Marian started working with Euro-rack synthesizer music and
soundtracks for her own experimental films, which she continues to make, often
incorporating her paintings. Her films have shown in the U.S.A. and in Europe over
the years.
