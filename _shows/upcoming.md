In America we make promises. We have promised the American Dream, the Industrial Revolution, and Inalienable Rights throughout the centuries. Sometimes we deliver those promises and sometimes we fall far short. In Michigan, we have work to do.

A Rock and a Hard Place is a visual study of Michigan. Artist Inga Loyeva visited Michigan to work on a collaborative community mural as a part of her Art For Civil Discourse projects in October 2017. The time spent there filled her with hope for a better America through the lens of the people crafting meaning in Michigan's cities. In this exposition, the artist portrays the scenes in both Detroit and Flint that narrates the intense philosophical debate in contemporary America. Do we deserve a dignified existence, and, if so, at what cost?
