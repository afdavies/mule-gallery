Western Editions brings together a handful of creatives, artists, and feminists for The Peep Show. With the current climate of womenâ€™s rights and LGBTQ rights, The Peep Show hopes to celebrate all women and bring to light our collective responsibility as a community to protect and preserve these rights. All artists have generously agreed to donate the majority of proceeds to Planned Parenthood. More info to come.
