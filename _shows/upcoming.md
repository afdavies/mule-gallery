**_Loud voices in tiny spaces_** is a continuation of a series Gina has been working on about the spaces
she's occupied throughout her life. From the childhood memories of her first room, to her grandparents’ living room, to her
current apartment in San Francisco, she reflects on evocative items —mementos, patterns, traces of broken relationships — that she's held on to and can’t seem to give up. In these tiny spaces she spends her time contemplating the past and creating something new.

[Gina M. Contreras](ginamcontreras.tumblr.com) is a painter and printmaker from Fresno, California. In 2008, she received a BFA in Printmaking from the San Francisco Art Institute. She currently lives and works in San Francisco.
