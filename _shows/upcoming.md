“But where are you really from?” is a question often asked of people of color. If it were a genuine inquiry, then a neighborhood or city should suffice. However, the repetitiveness and emphasis on “but” and “really” implies that it wasn’t the answer they were looking for when they were actually asking for ethnicity. Whether intentional or not, it creates a sense of otherness and that one could not possibly belong here based on physical features. 

The sign painting trade is a practice shared around the world but historically, the sign painting community in the US did not reflect the diversity of its people. In recent years, with the combination of the remaining trade school still teaching the sign painting curriculum, sign shops that have pulled through the vinyl scare / continue to take in apprentices, businesses big and small re-appreciating hand painted craftsmanship, and the immense amount of information available through the internet—we are breeding generations of diverse sign painters into the mix! 

As with any industry, representation matters so this showcase is all about celebrating diversity through and within sign painting. We have gathered sign painters from different backgrounds to answer that aggravating question with pride, if you really must know—this is where my family is from!
