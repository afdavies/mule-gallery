Inspired by the Bayeux Tapestries, Refugee Stories is a series of six embroidery panels that follow the recent journey of the Syrian refugees. The second largest mass migration in history is documented in various points along the refugeesâ€™ path. Each point along their journey was affected by geography: by sea or land, pastoral farmland or war town desert. Using news stories, Google Earth, and numerical data from the UN, each panel pieces the journey into one polyphonic map.
