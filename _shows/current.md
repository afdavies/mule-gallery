Sometimes what’s lost is not so much a thing, but a feeling.
Perhaps an opportunity. Opportunity cost, they call it.

This series explores the struggle of knowing there’s something else out there. Repeating images of interiors, exteriors, roads, and water evoke the circular logic of a search for answers. The sequencing and placement of each image form a visual narrative through which I invite you to consider your own opportunity lost.

These images were captured between 2013 and 2018, in the in-between moments of my life. For years I’ve found myself drawn to these empty scenes; I use the camera to capture the feeling of wonder of what could have been, and could still be.

Searching is presented as 18 giclée prints on Hahnemühle Photo Rag. Largest images are 30x40 inches, smallest are 15x20 inches.
