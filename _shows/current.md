This fall, we welcome Portland artist [Kate Bingaman-Burt] (http://www.katebingamanburt.com) to Mule Gallery. Kate's work orbits around the objects in our lives: the things we buy, the things we discard, and the collectivity and social interaction that can arise from cycles of consumption. Via illustrations, daily documentation, publications, events, and large-scale participatory projects, Kate’s work invites a dialogue about contemporary forms of exchange.

Stockpile! is a new installation featuring piles of zines, colorful banners and larger than life drawings focusing on her ongoing and completed drawing and photo projects. 

Kate has been making work about consumption since 2002, teaching since 2004 and drawing until her hand cramps since 2006. She lives in Portland, Oregon, where, along with being an Associate Professor of Graphic Design at Portland State University, she also makes piles of work about consumerism: zines! pillows! dresses! drawings! paper chains! photos! Starting in 2002, she photographed everything she purchased (finished in 2004). In 2004, she started drawing all of her credit card statements until they were paid off (finished in 2010). From 2006–2014, she drew something she purchased everyday. She also wants to draw your passwords, mix tapes, stolen goods, lottery tickets, receipts and yard sale signs. Along with being an educator and illustrator, she frequently travels to speak and to conduct workshops at a variety of universities and organizations. Kate is also on the Board of Directors for Design Week Portland, Independent Publishing Resource Center and Octopus Books.

Thanks to our sponsors [Fort Point Beer Company](http://www.fortpointbeer.com/) for keeping us hydrated at the reception.
