[Western Editions](http://www.westerneditions.com/) brings together a handful of creatives, artists, and feminists for The Peep Show. With the current climate of women’s rights and LGBTQ rights, The Peep Show hopes to celebrate all women and bring to light our collective responsibility as a community to protect and preserve these rights. All artists have generously agreed to donate the majority of proceeds to Planned Parenthood.
