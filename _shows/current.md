We are thrilled to have artist and author Austin Kleon at Mule Gallery this summer. He will be showing a mix of new work and some old favorites, including collages, drawings, and his newspaper blackout poems. The show opens on July 1, 2016 and closes on August 26, 2016. A reception for the artist will be held on July 1 from 6­-9pm.

Thanks to our sponsors [Fort Point Beer Company](http://www.fortpointbeer.com/) for keeping us hydrated at the reception.

Austin Kleon is the New York Times bestselling author of three illustrated books: Steal Like An Artist, Newspaper Blackout, and Show Your Work! His latest release is The Steal Like An Artist Journal: A Notebook For Creative Kleptomaniacs. His work has been translated into over twenty languages and featured on NPR’s Morning Edition, PBS Newshour, and in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. New York Magazine called his work “brilliant,” The Atlantic called him “positively one of the most interesting people on the Internet,” and The New Yorker said his poems “resurrect the newspaper when everybody else is declaring it dead.” He speaks about creativity in the digital age for organizations such as Pixar, Google, SXSW, TEDx, and The Economist. He grew up in the cornfields of Ohio, but now he lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife and sons. Visit him online at [www.austinkleon.com](http://www.austinkleon.com)
