We are excited to welcome San Francisco-based photographer [Troy Holden](http://troyholden.com/) presenting Colorful Streets, his very first solo exhibition and the first show of 2017 at Mule Gallery. The show opens on January 6, 2017 and closes on February 24, 2017. A reception for the photographer will be held on January 6 from 6-9pm.


Colorful Streets is an exhibition of color photographs taken in the streets of San Francisco. The show features candid snapshots of everyday life and its absurdities in the downtown neighborhoods. 


Troy Holden is a photographer who focuses his camera on the Mid-Market area of San Francisco. Since 2011, heâ€™s been taking daily walks looking for interesting faces and interactions in the crowded streets. His work has been featured in Juxtapoz, American Photo, and Hamburger Eyes. 

Thanks to our sponsors [Fort Point Beer Company](http://www.fortpointbeer.com/) for keeping us hydrated at the reception.
